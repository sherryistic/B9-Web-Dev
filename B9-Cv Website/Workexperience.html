    <p> I have been working at Fiverr as a Freelance Graphic Designer with over 5 years of experience. I have a passion
        for creating impressive designs. My abilities include but are not limited to logo design, business card design,
        social media graphics, and more. There are hundreds of services related to graphic design in my portfolio, and I

    <h2>Graphic designer</h2>
    <p><em>Tekmal Technologies</em> 5/21 - 1/21</p>
    <p>City: Karachi</p>
    <p>Country: Pakistan</p>
    <p> I worked at Tekmal technologies as a professional graphic designer. It was an amazing experience being
        surrounded by a dedicated team and in projects that are out of the box. I mainly worked on logo design and
        other marketing materials.</p>
    <h2>Logo Designer</h2>
    <p><em>Salsoft Technologies (Pvt) Ltd</em> 12/2017 – 04/2018</p>
    <p>City: Karachi</p>
    <p>Country: Pakistan</p>
    <p>I learned logo design and stationery design in a professional environment at Salsoft. The program aimed to
        combine theoretical concepts with the practical application of design elements. Salsoft has extensively
        developed
        to use of colors, shapes, fonts, and designs through creative exercises where I can practice designing my own
        logo or stationery for different purposes. It was quite amazing for me since I was not familiar with these
        fields.
        After completing them, I feel confident enough to apply them in my work and personal life.</p>
